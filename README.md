# IcedImages

### IcedImages was made in **React Native**. This mobile app takes image URLs from any platform with title and image tag parameters that are all saved locally on the app.

## How does it work?

### 1) Launching the app

![Home Screen](https://i.ibb.co/HHthzBM/unknown.png)

* The home screen is where you will see your stored images. An image of Batman, for example, is formatted into an imagecard with a given title and image tags.

* In order to add more images, press on the plus icon on the bottom right.

### 2) Adding More Images

![Add Image](https://i.ibb.co/ypmYYbN/unknown.png)

* A new screen will pop up, giving you room to paste an Image URL, give a title, and assign any image tags.

* Lets add another Batman image: https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Diesel%2Fproductv2%2Fbatman-arkham-knight%2FEGS_WB_Batman_Arkham_Knight_G1_1920x1080_19_0911-1920x1080-1d69e15f00cb5ab57249f208f1f8f45d52cbbc59.jpg?h=1080&resize=1&w=1920

![Add Image](https://i.ibb.co/cyPR3Lr/unknown.png)

* After pasting the URL in the top box, naming the image "Batman: Arkham Knight," and assigning some image tags ("batman, arkham, knight, game, batmobile), press "POST" to save the image locally.

### 3) View Your Gallery

![Home Screen](https://i.ibb.co/nrpycsf/unknown.png)

* Now, back on the home screen you can see the image has been posted and displays the same title and image tags that were put in earlier.

* Previous images are saved, so don't worry about losing your data!
